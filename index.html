    <h2> Inspiration & Audience </h2>
    <p>This first part is the inspiration for YOU doing the project. Spending 12 weeks on a project requires you to be really inspired by the topic. It is something you are willing to spend the time, beyond your day-to-day work. And hopefully, work on iterating on the output, even beyond the project time. It is a topic that you have been talking / thinking / planning about doing for a long-time and now is the right time to do it.</p>
      
    <p>The second part is the audience or user for your project. Be clear in what you want your audience or user to achieve based on the project. The audience can be small & niche or large & personas. Think of writing a hook for your project and try to write it as: [Who is the Audience] - [What is the Change Outcome]. The possible action outcome for your project can be:.</p>
